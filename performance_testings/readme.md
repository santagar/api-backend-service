## Use Locust to know how many concurrent users can my application support

Locust is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.

## Installation

Visit [documentation](http://docs.locust.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Start Locust

Run with the above Locust file, if it was named locustfile.py and located in the current working directory, we could run: 

    locust -f locustfile.py
    
Once youâ€™ve started Locust using one of the above command lines, you should open up a browser and point it to [http://127.0.0.1:8089](http://127.0.0.1:8089) (if you are running Locust locally)

More info about starting [here](http://docs.locust.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

### Meaning of requests.csv

Requests, failures, min. max. avg. response times, content and requests per second

```
Method  Name   #requests   #failures   Median response time   Average response time   Min response time   Max response time   Average content size   Requests/s
GET    /home   574         0           5900                   6363                    5596                17141               1214                   51.50
```

### Meaning of distribution.csv

If your target is to have 300ms at most, you can just cover the 66% requests so you will take the risk of your 34% percent of user to lose.

```
Method  Name    #requests   50%  66%    75%  80%    90%     95%    98%   99%    100%
GET    /home    14151       160  290    400  600    800     1100   1700  2000   13934
```
